# Splendor
Python non-gui implementation of boardgames Splendor Duel

14-01-2023: Added a board.fill_from_bag function which draws all chips from the bag,
            and places each chip on the board on empty squares according to the rules (starting
            inside out, clockwise)
            
14-01-2023: Added a different view from the board(spiral from the inside out)
            This is needed as this is the order in which the board must be refilled
            
Past:   Adding board, chips, a bag for the chips
